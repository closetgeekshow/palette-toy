# Agent Instructions
- Keep all functional code and markup changes inside `index.html`. Do not add new source files or assets unless explicitly requested in the task.
- When the task explicitly calls for new files, add them but do not introduce extra files beyond what is asked.
- Use CDN-hosted resources for any third-party libraries; avoid local bundling or package installations.
- Maintain existing lightweight setup without introducing build steps or additional tooling.
- Keep `menu.html` updated with links to every HTML demo in the repo whenever demos are added, removed, or renamed.
